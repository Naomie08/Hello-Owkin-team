_Because innovation starts with creativity (and a few lines of code)._

## 🚀 About This Project

Hi, I’m **Naomie** – a healthcare executive shifting toward the world of AI and health tech, with a passion for ethical, human-centered innovation.

Instead of a traditional cover letter, I decided to code my motivation. Why?  
Because I believe new ideas need new ways to connect.  
Plus, I love a little challenge!

**This script is for you if:**
- You’re part of a health tech team (Owkin, Withings, Arkhn, or just curious),
- You want to know what I stand for (spoiler: field expertise, ethics, and tech curiosity),
- Or you simply enjoy creative approaches in recruitment.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. **Clone or download this repo.**
2. Open `motivation_script.py` in your favorite Python IDE (or just use the command line).
3. Run:
    ```bash
    python motivation_script.py
    ```
4. Enter your name when prompted – try "Owkin" for the best experience!
